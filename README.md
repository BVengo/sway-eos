# EOS Sway Setup Script
A setup script and config files for preparing my custom Sway environment in EndeavourOS.

## Usage
<span style="color:red">**This script is intended for my own personal use, to be run on a fresh install of EndeavourOS. As such, it has no confirmations before installing dependencies or moving files around. However, existing config files will be marked as .bak as a precaution.**</span>.

To use this setup script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bvengo/eos-sway.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd eos-sway
   ```

3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ```

4. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

This will install all necessary dependencies and set up all the custom configs.
